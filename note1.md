### Question 1

**Wi-Fi is a _X_ technology used in _Y_**
- [ ] A. wired, LAN
- [ ] B. wired, WAN
- [ ] C. wireless, LAN
- [ ] D. wireless, WAN

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: C</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Wi-Fi 係一種 wireless (無線) 技術，通常用嚟組建一個 LAN (Local Area Network) 局部區域網絡，例如喺屋企或者辦公室。WAN (Wide Area Network) 係廣域網絡，覆蓋範圍大好多，好似成個城市或國家，通常係用光纖、衛星等技術連接。</p>
<p><em>(Wi-Fi is a wireless technology typically used to set up a LAN (Local Area Network), like at home or in an office. A WAN (Wide Area Network) covers a much larger area, like a city or country, and usually uses technologies like fiber optics or satellites for connection.)</em></p>

### Question 2

**Which of the following connects LANs to form a WAN?**
- [ ] A. Modem
- [ ] B. Router
- [ ] C. Switch
- [ ] D. Bridge

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: B</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Router (路由器) 嘅主要功能係連接唔同嘅網絡，例如將你屋企嘅 LAN 連接到 Internet (最大嘅 WAN)。Modem (數據機) 負責將 ISP (互聯網服務供應商) 嘅信號轉換成你 router 可以理解嘅數據。Switch (交換機) 只係喺一個 LAN 內部轉發數據，唔負責連接唔同網絡。</p>
<p><em>(The main function of a router is to connect different networks, for example, connecting your home LAN to the Internet (the largest WAN). A modem is responsible for converting the signal from your ISP (Internet Service Provider) into data your router can understand. A switch only forwards data within a single LAN and is not responsible for connecting different networks.)</em></p>

### Question 3

**Which of the following is a commonly used technology for LANs?**
<br>(1) Ethernet
<br>(2) Wi-Fi
<br>(3) Satellite transmission

- [ ] A. (1) only
- [ ] B. (2) only
- [ ] C. (1) and (2) only
- [ ] D. (1) and (3) only

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: C</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> 組成一個 LAN 最常用嘅就係 Ethernet (乙太網，即係插 LAN 線) 同 Wi-Fi (無線)。Satellite transmission (衛星傳輸) 通常係用喺 WAN 環境，或者係一啲偏遠地區上網用，唔係 LAN 常用技術。</p>
<p><em>(The most common technologies for forming a LAN are Ethernet (using a LAN cable) and Wi-Fi (wireless). Satellite transmission is typically used in WAN environments or for internet access in remote areas, not as a common LAN technology.)</em></p>

### Question 4

**Which of the following descriptions about peer-to-peer networks is correct?**
- [ ] A. Peer-to-peer networks facilitate central administration.
- [ ] B. Peer-to-peer networks have higher security than client/server networks.
- [ ] C. Peer-to-peer networks are more scalable.
- [ ] D. Peer-to-peer networks share data using workstations.

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: D</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Peer-to-peer (P2P) 網絡係一個去中心化 (decentralized) 嘅架構，冇中央伺服器 (central server) 去管理，所以 A 錯。因為冇中央管理，security (安全性) 通常比 Client/Server 網絡低，所以 B 錯。當電腦數量增加時，管理會變得好困難，所以 scalable (擴展性) 差，所以 C 錯。P2P 網絡入面，每部電腦 (workstation) 都可以直接同其他電腦分享資源同數據。</p>
<p><em>(A Peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a decentralized architecture without a central server for management, so A is incorrect. Due to the lack of central administration, security is generally lower than in Client/Server networks, so B is incorrect. As the number of computers grows, management becomes very difficult, meaning it has poor scalability, so C is incorrect. In a P2P network, each computer (workstation) can directly share resources and data with others.)</em></p>

### Question 5

**Which of the following is most probably found in a server but not a workstation?**
- [ ] A. Backup facility
- [ ] B. Network card
- [ ] C. GPU
- [ ] D. SATA hard disk

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: A</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Server (伺服器) 其中一個重要功能係保障數據安全同可用性，所以通常會有專業嘅 backup facility (備份設施)，例如磁帶機 (tape drives) 或者 RAID (磁碟陣列) 做熱備份。Network card (網卡)、GPU (顯示卡) 同 SATA hard disk (硬碟) 喺普通 workstation (工作站) 都好常見。</p>
<p><em>(A key function of a server is to ensure data safety and availability, so it usually comes with professional backup facilities like tape drives or RAID for hot backups. Network cards, GPUs, and SATA hard disks are all very common in regular workstations.)</em></p>
</details>

### Question 6

**Which of the following is a disadvantage of client-server networking compared to peer-to-peer networking?**
<br>(1) Higher setup costs
<br>(2) Difficult to maintain
<br>(3) Resources are allocated across different computers with different versions of resources.

- [ ] A. (1) only
- [ ] B. (2) only
- [ ] C. (1) and (2) only
- [ ] D. (1) and (3) only

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: C</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Client-Server 網絡需要買專門嘅 server hardware (伺服器硬件) 同 software (軟件)，所以 setup costs (初始成本) 比較高 (1)。同時，管理同維護一個 server 需要專業知識，所以 difficult to maintain (維護困難) (2)。選項 (3) 描述嘅係 P2P 網絡嘅缺點，因為資源分散喺唔同電腦，管理混亂。</p>
<p><em>(A Client-Server network requires purchasing dedicated server hardware and software, leading to higher setup costs (1). Additionally, managing and maintaining a server requires specialized knowledge, making it difficult to maintain (2). Option (3) describes a disadvantage of P2P networks, where resources are scattered across different computers, leading to chaotic management.)</em></p>

### Question 7

**Which of the following can be shared in a network environment?**
<br>(1) Data
<br>(2) Software
<br>(3) Hardware

- [ ] A. (1) and (2) only
- [ ] B. (1) and (3) only
- [ ] C. (2) and (3) only
- [ ] D. (1), (2) and (3)

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: D</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> 網絡嘅主要目的就係共享資源。Data (數據，例如文件), Software (軟件，例如網絡版嘅應用程式), 同 Hardware (硬件，例如 printer 打印機、scanner 掃描器) 全部都可以透過網絡共享。</p>
<p><em>(The primary purpose of a network is to share resources. Data (e.g., files), Software (e.g., networked applications), and Hardware (e.g., printers, scanners) can all be shared over a network.)</em></p>
</details>

### Question 8

**Which of the following can be shared in a network environment?**
<br>(1) Mouse
<br>(2) Printer
<br>(3) Scanner

- [ ] A. (2) only
- [ ] B. (3) only
- [ ] C. (2) and (3) only
- [ ] D. (1), (2) and (3)

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: C</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Printer (打印機) 同 Scanner (掃描器) 都係常見可以共享嘅網絡硬件，好多公司都係一部 printer 全公司用。Mouse (滑鼠) 係個人輸入設備，直接連接單一電腦使用，唔會喺網絡上共享。</p>
<p><em>(Printers and scanners are common pieces of network hardware that can be shared; many offices have one printer for the entire company. A mouse is a personal input device connected directly to a single computer and is not shared over a network.)</em></p>

### Question 9

**Which of the following are the benefits of setting up a small office or home office?**
<br>(1) Shared Internet connection service
<br>(2) Preventing computer virus infections
<br>(3) Shared network subscription for paid TV or movie accounts

- [ ] A. (1) only
- [ ] B. (2) only
- [ ] C. (1) and (2) only
- [ ] D. (2) and (3) only

<details>
<summary>Answer + Note</summary>
<p><b>Correct Answer: A</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> 設立一個 SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) 網絡最基本同最大嘅好處就係可以 share Internet connection (共享上網)，一條寬頻線俾多部裝置用 (1)。網絡本身唔會防止病毒，反而如果保安做得唔好，一部機中毒可能會感染成個網絡，所以 (2) 唔啱。好多 TV/movie accounts 嘅訂閱條款都限制咗只可以喺同一家庭內使用，唔算係一個 formal 嘅網絡好處，所以 (3) 唔啱。</p>
<p><em>(The most fundamental and significant benefit of setting up a SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) network is the ability to share the Internet connection, allowing multiple devices to use a single broadband line (1). A network itself doesn't prevent viruses; in fact, with poor security, one infected machine could infect the entire network, so (2) is incorrect. Many TV/movie subscription terms of service restrict use to a single household, so this is not considered a formal benefit of networking, making (3) incorrect.)</em></p>
